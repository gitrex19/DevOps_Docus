Install Docker
The Docker docs suggest setting up a Docker repository to install and update from.
This is where you should start: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository

Login to the Dockerhub
In order to push and pull images, you will need to login to the Dockerhub. In your terminal, run docker login and then enter your Dockerhub account's username and password.

Test Docker installation
After completing the installation steps, test out Docker by running sudo docker run hello-world. This should download and run the test container printing "hello world" to your console.

Installing Docker Compose
Unlike the Mac and Windows Docker Desktop versions, we must manually install Docker Compose. See the instructions for the installation steps (Click on the tab for Linux)
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

Testing Docker Compose
After completing, test your installation by running docker-compose -v. This should print the version and build numbers to your console.

Run without Sudo
Follow these instructions to run Docker commands without sudo:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

Start on Boot
Follow these instructions so that Docker and its services start automatically on boot:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot

You may need to restart your system before starting the course material.
